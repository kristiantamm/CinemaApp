## Previous experience
  I have never used Spring Boot before and I have used React.js only once before. I think that this is a good<br>
  testament of how fast of learner I am. Also I did this project while being active in college. <br>
## Development notes
  -Overall the project took around 12h<br>
  -Main obstacles were setting up everything, seating suggestion(still not 100%) and bugs along the development.<br>
  -I would've liked to implement the suggestion by user history. I would have used cookies to collect user history and hold<br>
   what movies user is interested in the database.<br>
